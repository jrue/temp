Things I like to do in Berkeley are:

* Stay safe during quarantine
* Cook tasty meals 
* Study hard for J-Rue's class

My plans for this weekend are:

1. Complete all assignments for this course.
2. Seriously, complete all of the assignments for this course.
3. Double-check I did the assignments for this course.
